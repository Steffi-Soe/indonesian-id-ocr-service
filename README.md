# 🪪 Indonesian Document OCR API (KTP & SIM)

This project provides a **Flask-based REST API** for extracting structured data from Indonesian identity documents, including **ID Cards (KTP)** and **Driving Licenses (SIM)**, using **PaddleOCR**.

It automatically identifies the document type, performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR), intelligently processes the text, and formats the results into a clean, standardized JSON structure.
The pipeline is designed to be **robust against real-world capture issues**, including **minor skew, rotation, and tilt** commonly found in mobile-captured document images.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔤 **OCR powered by PaddleOCR (Bahasa Indonesia model)**
* ✅ **Multi-Document Support:** Accurately processes both KTP and SIM cards
* 🔍 **Automatic Document Identification**
* 🧭 **Skew, rotation, and tilt handling** to improve OCR accuracy on misaligned documents
* 🧠 **Smart text processing** using spatial, confidence-based, and regex-driven logic
* 🧹 **Post-processing & normalization** of extracted fields
* 🧪 **OCR diagnostics & debugging support** (bounding boxes, legends, traceability)
* 📦 **Standardized JSON Output** across document types

## 🧰 Requirements

Ensure you have Python **3.8+** installed.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ⚠️ `paddlepaddle` (the backend for PaddleOCR) might need to be installed manually depending on your system:
>
> ```bash
> # For CPU
> pip install paddlepaddle==3.2.0
>
> # For GPU (ensure you have a compatible CUDA version)
> pip install paddlepaddle-gpu==3.2.0
> ```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A client sends a POST request to the API with an image file (**KTP or SIM**) as `multipart/form-data`.
2. The Flask server validates and temporarily stores the image.
3. **Preprocessing logic** normalizes the image and mitigates minor **skew, rotation, or tilt** when detected.
4. The **DocumentProcessor** identifies whether the document is a KTP or SIM.
5. OCR is performed using PaddleOCR.
6. Extractors (`KTPExtractor` / `SIMExtractor`) analyze bounding boxes, spatial alignment, and confidence scores.
7. Fields are cleaned, normalized, and structured.
8. The API returns a standardized JSON response.

## 🧭 Orientation & OCR Robustness

To improve accuracy on real-world images, the pipeline includes logic and analysis for:

* Detecting **slight rotation and skew** based on OCR bounding box geometry
* Ensuring consistent line alignment and label–value pairing
* Applying corrections **only when necessary** to avoid disrupting already-correct cases
* Using OCR legends and confidence patterns to guide incremental improvements

Debug artifacts (visual bounding boxes, OCR legends, and extraction traces) are available to support tuning and analysis.

## ⚙️ Customization

You can tune or extend the system by modifying:

* **OCR preprocessing & orientation handling** in `document_processor.py`
* **Field definitions & keywords** in extractor files
* **Regex patterns & confidence thresholds** for specific edge cases
* **Debug visualization & traceability** to analyze OCR behavior

## 🧪 Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue                             | Possible Cause         | Recommended Fix                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| OCR text misaligned               | Image skew or tilt     | Ensure good lighting; preprocessing handles minor tilt |
| Low confidence fields             | Blurry or angled image | Use higher-resolution input                            |
| OCR returned no results           | Poor image quality     | Retake image with clearer focus                        |
| Could not determine document type | Non-KTP/SIM image      | Upload a valid Indonesian ID                           |
| paddlepaddle not found            | Dependency missing     | Install `paddlepaddle` manually                        |
